Checkout my [network-programming](https://github.com/Hypro999/network-programming) repository for some slightly more advanced Network and Unix Systems Programming in C.

Also checkout my team's [compiler-project](https://github.com/Hypro999/compiler-project) repository for an application of C in making a rudimentary compiler.
